00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.890
I love you way too often.

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.460
We can fight this. You're right, the cancer
is only my liver, lungs, prostate and brain,

3
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.100
all the things I can live without.

4
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.370
What if I told you we can make you better?

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.700
You're a fighter. We can give you abilities.

6
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.080
Most men only dream of make you a superhero.

7
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.250
He just promise you'll do right by me so I
can do right by someone else and please don't

8
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.710
make me super green or animated.

9
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.960
One thing that never survives this place is
a sense of humor.

10
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.210
We'll see about that Posh Spice.

11
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.520
Oh, come on, you know, leave me all alone
here with less angry Rosie O'Donnell.

12
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.630
I won't issue a single sex vessel in the
back I want to take him out of but like that

13
00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.470
shotgun.

14
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.240
I want to know how does the.

15
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.760
Rick.

16
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.390
What you may be wondering, why the red suit,
well, that's so bad, guys can't see me bleed.

17
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.520
This guy's got the right idea.

18
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.640
He wore the brown pants kind of music.

19
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.090
You get what they call.

20
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.680
Oh. The enemy.

21
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.260
How many cats are?

22
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.880
Wreaks like old lady pants in here.

23
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.340
Why such a douche this morning?

24
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.110
Oh, God, you are hard to look at.

25
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.780
He looks like a topographical map of Utah.

26
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.890
Exactly.

27
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.620
Sam. The one is enough.

28
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.450
Oh, I am very turned on right now.

29
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.320
You it you are haunting it look like an
avocado had sex with an older avocado.

30
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.760
Thank you. Greetings, Munchkins.

31
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.110
Did you like that dosa green band goodness,
hankering for a little more action, some

32
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.160
bigwig curse words, maybe check out Deadpool
website Dotcom for my red band trailer.

33
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.380
Make sure to ask your mommy and tell her to
call me.

34
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.160
She's got the number.
