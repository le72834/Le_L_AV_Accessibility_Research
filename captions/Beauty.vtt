My dear Bill, so ahead of your time, this is
a small village, you are the most gorgeous

2
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.180
thing I've ever seen.

3
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.720
Nobody deserves it and it's small minded as
well.

4
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.970
But small also means safe.

5
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:33.040
But. Please come to

6
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.860
my father. Come into the light.

7
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:50.460
Xeriscaping. Look, a girl who said that,
hello, you can talk and of course,

8
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.870
it's all he ever does.

9
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.700
How lovely to make your acquaintance want to
see me do a trick.

10
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.550
He's won the last battle for the Nestel
remains a beast for a.

11
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.060
And we become Antwerp's.

12
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.790
What did he do to get out of here?

13
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.070
You have to help me.

14
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:33.200
You have to stand. If she is the one who
will break the spell,

15
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.400
you must finally learn to love, tell us all
this time.

16
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.190
Have you really read every one of these
books somewhere in Greek?

17
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.250
I can read.

18
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.110
Ptolemy's.
